# Google-DA-Capstone-Project

## This project uses data from an imaginary company called Cyclistic, 
## which contains data of bike riders for a number of years. This project
## analyzes the year 2014 only, which contains trips and stations data.

# The aims of this project is to find how different 
## Customers (riders who purchased a 24-Hour Pass) 
## Subscribers (riders who purchased an Annual Membership) are
## and how to get more Customers to upgrade to Subscribers. 

# Data Preparation
## Installed and loaded packages to import data, compare columns names and data types 
## in order to prevent any errors when merging data.

# Data Analysis and Visualization
## Compared the number and the duration of trips by Customers and Subscribers  
## by day of the week and month of the year. Popular stations were also 
## analyzed and visualized. 

# Interpretation
## The analysis for day of the week shows that Customers take a lot of rides 
## on the weekends.
## The visualization for trip number for the month  analysis shows that 
## Subscribers took a lot of trips that year, but Customers have 
## high trip times from April go August.
## Customers start their trips at 6 out of 10 of the popular stations
## and end it at any 7 of the 10 of the popular stations.

# Recommendations
## Advertisements or promotions should be made available to popular Customer stations
## on the weekends between April to August to get Customers to upgrade their subscriptions.
